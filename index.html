					<h1>About Me</h1>
				
					<img class="auth-image" src="assets/images/Benny.png" alt="Benny picture">
					<p>My name is Benny and I live and work in Orange County. I attended the University of Southern California and graduated with a major in Economics, minor in Business-Technology, and specialization in SAP. Previously, I was the office manager for Wilshire Cardiology Group located in Downtown Los Angeles. I am currently working at Meridianlink in Costa Mesa as a Technical Service Representative.
					</p>

					<p>I have an interest in tennis, breakdancing, and tinkering with electronics. When it comes to the phones I am an Android fan and use Windows as my OS of choice. Recently,  I also completed the Coding Bootcamp with UCI's Continuing Education program. My interest in coding and development arose during my work at Meridianlink as I assisted clients with integrating to our APIs. This is an early showcase of my work and hope you enjoy!
